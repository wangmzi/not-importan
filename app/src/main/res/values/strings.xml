           Mountain Pose — Tadasana (tah-DAHS-uh-nuh) — is an active pose that helps improve posture, balance, and calm focus.
           Its name comes from the Sanskrit words "tada" (meaning "mountain") and "asana" (meaning "pose").
           Tadasana is the foundational pose for all standing yoga postures and full inversions, such as Handstand and Headstand.
           It is the pose from which every other standing pose in your practice is born!
